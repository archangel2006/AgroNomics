## 🎯 Problem 
Farmers face significant financial losses due to unpredictable crop prices, lack of reliable forecasting tools, and decisions based on guesswork rather than data-driven insights.

## 💡 Solution
AgroNomics is a web-based machine learning platform that predicts upcoming crop prices using historical datasets and advanced regression models. It provides a clean, intuitive interface designed for farmers, offering state and district-level insights across multiple crop categories in India.

## ✨ Key Features
- **Accurate Price Prediction**: Forecasts crop prices based on state, district, season, and crop type using advanced ML models.
- **Extensive Crop Database**: Covers 9 major crop categories with 200+ commodities, including grains, pulses, vegetables, fruits, spices, and cash crops.
- **Nationwide Coverage**: Supports all 28 states, 8 union territories, and 700+ districts across India.
- **Seasonal Intelligence**: Considers seasonal variations (Zaid, Kharif, Post-Monsoon, and Rabi) for precise predictions.

## 📈 Market Impact
- **AgriTech Growth**: $30.6B (2024) → $79.7B (2030) globally, with India projected to reach $24-30B by 2027 (~50% CAGR).
- **Key Benefits**:
  - Reduces farmer losses due to price volatility  
  - Promotes data-driven agriculture  
  - Decreases dependency on middlemen

## 🏗️ System Architecture
User Input → Flask Backend → ML Model → Price Prediction → Web Interface
- **User Input**: State, District, Crop Category, Crop, Month, Season.
- **Backend (Flask)**: Processes input and calls the ML model.
- **ML Model (Random Forest)**: Predicts the crop price using trained data.
- **Price Prediction**: Returns modal price per kilogram.
- **Web Interface**: Displays the results in a clean and user-friendly manner. Print Result.

## 🎮 Usage 
1. Open the homepage.
2. Select State, District, Crop Category, Crop, Month, and Season.
3. Click "Predict Price" to view the estimated price (₹/kg).

## 🔧 Troubleshooting
- **Model Loading Error**: Ensure `model.pkl` and `encoder.pkl` are in the project directory.  
- **Missing Templates**: All HTML files must be in the `templates/` folder. 
- **Port in Use**: Stop other processes or use `python app.py --port=5001`.
